Many times there is going to be uncertainty with some event.
Eg. Rover on Mars
    Weather Prediction
Usually the events are represented by omega(ω), so P(ω) means probability of the event ω.
    In Games based on chance
    Some Axioms:
    . 0 =< P(ω) =< 1
    . SIGMA P(ω) = 1
    
    Unconditional Probability - Degree of belief in a proposition in the absence of any other evidence.
    eg. probability that the sum of numbers on the roll of two dice.
    Conditional Probability - Degree of belief in a proposition given some evidence that has been revealed.
                              Notation - P(a|b), probability of a given b is true.
    Eg. P(rain today| rain yesterday)
        P(route change| traffic conditions)
        P(disease| test results)
        P(A|B)*P(B) = P(A^B) = P(B|A)*P(A)
        
    A random variable in probability theory is a variable that can take on a whole range of values from a set
    Eg. Random variable Weather = {Sun, Rain, Snow, Cloud, Wind}
    A probability distribution would take a random variable and assigns a probability for each of the events.
    Eg. Random Variable Flight = {On Time, Delayed, Cancelled}
        P(Flight) = <0.6,0.3,0.1> (Vectorial Notation)

    Independence - Knowing the probability of one event does not affect the probability of the other event.
    Eg. Roll of two dice, the outcome of first die has no influence on the second one.
    The rule followed for two independent events a and b 
    P(a^b) = P(a)*P(b|a) = P(a)*P(b)(since occurence of a has not effect on b)

    Bayes Rule:
        P(b|a) = P(a|b)*P(b)/P(a)

    JOINT Probability Distribution:

          | R = rain | R = !rain
C = cloud | 0.08     | 0.32
C = !cloud| 0.02     | 0.58

Some RULES ->
Negation Rule: P(!a) = 1 - P(a)
Inclusion-Exclusion: P(a v b) = p(a) + p(b) - p(a ^ b)
Marginalization: P(a) = P(a and b) + P(a and !b), in other words, P(x) = SIGMA(y varies) P(x and y)

Bayesian Network:
Data structure that represents the dependecies among random variables.
. Directed Graph
. Each node represents a random variable
. arrow from X to Y means X is a parent of Y
. Each node X has a probability distribution P(X|Parents(X))
